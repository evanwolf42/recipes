Cobbler

INGREDIENTS
    4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
    4 cups fresh or defrosted fruit
    1 cup sugar, plus more for (optional) sprinkling
    1 cup flour
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    Pinch fine sea salt
    1 cup whole milk
    1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

INSTRUCTIONS
    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
    2. Place the butter in a large (10- to 12-inch) cast-iron skillet (may substitute a large ovenproof baking dish) and place in the oven so the butter melts; this should take 5 to 7 minutes.
    3. Meanwhile, place the fruit in a large mixing bowl. Use a potato masher to mash the fruit just enough so that it releases some of its juices
    4. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a separate medium bowl. Add the cup of sugar, milk and vanilla extract, stirring until well incorporated.
    5. Remove the skillet from the oven. Carefully pour the melted butter from the skillet into the batter, stirring to combine, then pour the batter all at once into the skillet. Add the fruit and juices to the center of the batter. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the batter comes out mostly clean. Serve warm, straight from the skillet.
