Chocolate Chip Cookies

INGREDIENTS
    1 cup unsalted butter
    1/2 cups white sugar
    1 1/2 cup brown sugar
    2 cold eggs
    2.5 cups flour
    1 tbsp kosher salt (2 1/4 tsp table salt)
    1/2 tsp baking soda
    1/2 tsp baking powder
    3/4 tsp cinnamon
    Chocolate chips (Roughly 2 cups)
    1/2 tbsp Vanilla extract

INSTRUCTIONS
    1. Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it’s re-solidified.
    2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. Mix well to combine.
    3. Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.
    4. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour, 1 Tbsp of kosher salt, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract and 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.
    5. Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. This helps keep your gluten down.
    6. Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.
    7. Roll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet. This will help give the cookies a rustic look. Bake in a 350°F oven for 12-17 minutes or until they’ve reached your preferred doneness. Top with a little bit of sea salt.
    8. Let cool for a few minutes, serve and enjoy.
