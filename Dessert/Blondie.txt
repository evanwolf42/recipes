Blondie

INGREDIENTS
    2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
    1/2 cup packed brown sugar
    1 egg yolk
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1/4 teaspoon baking powder
    1/8 teaspoon salt
    1/3 cup all purpose flour
    1/2 cup mix-ins (chocolate chips, peanut butter, berries, etc)

INSTRUCTIONS
    1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F, place tray at bottom of oven. Spray a 8" cast iron skillet with nonstick cooking spray (or butter).
    2. Mix the butter and brown sugar with a hand mixer in a large bowl until crumbly, then mix in the egg yolk, vanilla, baking powder, and salt. Mix in flour, then stir in add-ins. I used butterscotch chips and shredded coconut.
    3. Bake for about 18-24 minutes or until the outer edges and center are golden brown, but the center is still a big jiggly. Err on the side of under done, it will continue cooking as it cools and taste better a bit gooey.
