INSTRUCTIONS
  Mashed Potatoes
    1. Place the prepared potatoes into a large pot of cool water. Cover and bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-high and cook for about 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender. 
    2. Drain the water and add the butter, milk, salt and pepper to the potatoes in the pot. Mash until desired consistency then fold in the Parmesan -- if using. I like to use my hand mixer and blend until smooth. 
    3. Cool to room temperature.

  Shepards Pie
    1. Preheat your oven to 400Â°.
    2. Brown the ground beef, onion and garlic, on high heat, in a cast iron skillet. Stir often, ensuring that the beef does not stick to the bottom of the skillet. Once fully cooked, remove from the hot element and drain the grease drippings. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, flour, salt, pepper, peas and corn. If using several ingredients which release moisture (Corn, Mushrooms, Peppers) note that it takes a long time to properly release enough moisture. 
    3. Spread the mashed potatoes on top of the beef mixture.
    4. Make a pattern with a fork on the mashed potatoes, sprinkle the grated cheese on top.
    5. Bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and the beef filling is starting to bubble around the sides of the skillet. It should take 15-25 minutes.
    6. Let the pie rest about 5 minutes before serving.
