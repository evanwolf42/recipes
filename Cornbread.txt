Sweet Cornbread

INGREDIENTS
    1 cup flour
    1 cup yellow corn meal
    1 tbsp baking powder
    1/2 tsp. salt
    1 cup milk
    1 egg
    5 tbsp. vegetable oil

    butter

INSTRUCTIONS
    1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400Â°F. Place butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Transfer skillet to oven and heat until the butter is melted and well browned, 10 to 20 minutes minutes (you can measure your wet and dry ingredients while waiting). Pour browned butter into a heatproof cup or bowl, leaving about 1 tablespoon remaining in skillet.
    2. Combine ingredients. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in reserved browned butter. Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until homogenous.
    3. Remove skillet from the oven and swirl to coat all surfaces with melted butter. Spoon batter into skillet, smooth top lightly, then transfer to oven. Bake until light golden brown on top and a wooden skewer inserted into cornbread comes out with no crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then serve with extra butter and honey at the table. Leftover cornbread can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
